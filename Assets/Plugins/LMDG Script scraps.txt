Lucy's Dressing Room:
Game Start:
Narrator: Cameras roll in 5 minutes, contestants to the stage! 
Lucy: Well shit, better get ready. 
Lucy: And I guess that means watching my mouth, too. 
"Oh no! I'm going to be late! I can hear the applause already!"
Lights:
"How the hell am I supposed to get made up with such a dim light?"
Mirror:
"Don't believe their lies. Don't believe their lies."
Other mirror:
"This one is the worst liar."
Drawer:
"Just for show. This is just a false front."
"How appropriate."
Door:
"My star is faded. Nameplate is crooked, too. What a dump."
After First Q&A:
"Shit shit shit SHIT!"
"I HATE baking."
"If this were latte-making, I'd be all set!"
"Fuck my life."

Backstage Hallway:
First load:
"I wonder if Donna's out there already."
"She might not have heard, all the way at the other end of the hall."
Before the bakeoff:
"Donna is undefeated at the pie competition. I wonder what's her secret."
If player has laxitive:
"Looks like I'm about to give Donna...a run for her money!"
Own dressing room door:
"You'd think they could at least PAINT the door once every few years..."
Donna's Dressing Room door:
"This door is the nicest thing about that bitch."
Stage door:
(look) "I'm surprised nobody's here to open the door for me!"
First Q&A: "Better get in there. You've got this!"
Bakeoff: "Okay, let's get cooking!"

Donna's Dressing room:
Before first Q&A:
Donna: "Get out of here, you crazy bitch!"
Before bakeoff: "Looks like Donna isn't here."
Cookbook:
Look:
"Huh. Look at that. A cookbook. Some domestic goddess..."
"Hey! Look at that! It's bookmarked to a pie recipe!"
Interact:
Lucy: "Let's take a look."
"Granny's Old Time Apple Pie:"
"1. Preheat Oven to 400 degrees."
"2. Add Flour."
"3. Add Butter."
"4. Add Apples."
5. Add Spice."
"We'll leave the rest to you, sweetie! Make your hubby happy with an apple pie today!"
Mirror:
"Wow, I look...better than usual. Flattering."
Other mirror:
"Even her mirrors look better than mine..."
Lights:
"God, even her LIGHTS are more flattering!"
Door:
"Shiny star, fresh paint. There should be fucking cameras back here."
Drawer:
Look:
"Yep, of course hers are real..."
Interact:
Lucy: "I wonder what sort of secrets she has in here..."
Opening the drawer,  you find a half-empty bottle of laxatives."
"Huh. I guess she really IS full of shit."
"Gross. She's almost...human."

Kitchen:
Oven:
Off:
"The oven is off. Shall I turn it on?"
Yes: Nothing warms my heart quite like a fire in the kitchen.
Look: "Things are heating up!"
No: No, not yet. Not yet.
Look: "Shouldn't it be...I don't know, ovening? Is that even a word?"
If oven is full:
Interact: I should let it do its thing.
Camera:
"Don't look at the camera. Don't look at the camera."
Apples: "Wow, these are big. Somebody could really choke on them..."
Butter: "Gosh, it would be terrible if somebody were to slip and fall on this and hit their head horribly..."
Flour:
If not spiked: "*Cough Cough* Oh boy, somebody could asphyxiate if they breathe too much of this..."
If spiked: "*laughs hysterically.*"
Spice: Hope nobody gets this in their eyes or anything. That would sting awfully."
Bowl:
"What should I add first/next/last?"
If full:
"Okay pie, time to get baked!"
Pie tin:
If oven is open: "I wonder if Sylvia Plath ever baked any pies."
If oven is closed: "Wait a second! I'm forgetting something!"
Look at laxitive in inventory:
If flour has been added: "Boy, Donna's really going to give the judges a...run for their money."
If flour is not in pie: "Woah! Hang on! I don't want to ruin MY pie!"
Puzzle end:
Robert: "Lucy, please step away from the kitchen for just a few moments. It's time for Donna to work her magic!"
